            The video itself was rendered at constant 60 fps rate and features
            perfectly smooth animation, so if you're seeing any twitches,
            the problem is in your system setup.
            Last time I checked, iPhone 4, MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi B+
            played the video pretty well.
            I couldn't get satisfactory results on Sony Ion, Lenovo Thinkpad
            and Playstation 3 though...</p></div>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I wrote this thingy back in 2008 over a course of 3 months.
            I wanted to create a game with very smooth animations and
            transitions everywhere.
            Before long I realized that on some platforms it's problematic
            to achieve consistent graphics performance even in principle.
            Moreover, the tools I chose made porting the game to a more
            suitable platform complicated.
            So, I decided to get the game to some stable point and
            stop the development there.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I'm sharing this in hope it might inspire some bright head to
            create something beautiful.
            Or perhaps someone might even want to finalize this project and
            make a real game out of it.
            In either case, thank you for checking out this page,
            enjoy yourself!</p>
